This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: attempting to create multiple mutable borrows to the same variable.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` shows how to fix it using techniques like cloning or ownership transfer.  The core issue lies in Rust's ownership and borrowing system, which is designed to prevent data races and ensure memory safety.
